One of the comments received from feedback was that consistacy was poor, however not all of my commits were registering. For example none of the commits from April 16th registered as per image 1. I took a screen grab (image 2) on April 16th as I noticed this was happening. Kindly please take this into consideration when scoring consistancy as I believe this was not the only example of this.
